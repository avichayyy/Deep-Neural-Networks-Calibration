# About
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are a type of learned functions which consist of multiple layers between the input and output layers. These layers consist of neurons, where each connection transfers data from one neuron in a lower layer to another in a higher layer. <br>
Most applications of DNNs are to classify between different samples of certain data in by learning from a labeled dataset consisting of N pairs of (X<sub>i</sub>, Y<sub>i</sub>) where X is the input and y is the expected output. <br>
It has been shown that DNNs suffer from miscalibration i.e. misalignment between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes. This project investigates the phenomenon of miscalibration in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) when applied to audio datasets.
We have tested several architectures of DNNs on several audio datasets to see if they suffer from miscalibration and found that the problem exists in audio datasets as well. Furthermore, the same results applied to image classification DNNs can be applied to audio DNNs. <br>
